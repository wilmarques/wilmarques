### Hi there 👋

I'm a Front-End Developer. Specialized in Web development, but also knows something about Android.

Currently I'm learning a lot about Flutter, but I have 5+ years of experience with Angular.

As I believe that is very important to know about other things related to programming, I have some experience with Back-End development using Java, C# and Node.

Other important things:

- 🇧🇷 Brazilian
- 👨‍👩‍👦 Married and father of a little daughter
- 🥸 Love spreading knowledge
- 🎷 Play Clarinet since 10 years old, and a little bit of Sax for fun
